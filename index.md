# Introduction
This site was designed to represent all the site created and their project
This site is under construction so if there are any errors then try to help us correct them using this [link].(https://github.com/karamiad/home-fr/edit/main/README.md)

Your site will use the layout and styles of the Jekyll theme you selected in your [Repository settings] (https://github.com/karamiad/karamiad.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll configuration file `_config.yml`.
